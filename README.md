# Light Speed Sort 🚀✨

Welcome to **Light Speed Sort**, the fastest journey through the cosmos of sorting algorithms you'll ever embark on! 🌌 Hosted at [Magalvo's GitHub space station](https://github.com/Magalvo/light_speed_sort), this project is not your ordinary sorting utility. It's a hyperdrive experience designed to sort your data at the speed of light, leaving traditional methods lost in the space dust.

## Why Light Speed Sort? 🤔💡

In the vast expanse of the universe, where data is as abundant as the stars, **Light Speed Sort** emerges as the hero we didn't know we needed. It's not just fast; it's light-speed fast, meticulously engineered to handle your sorting needs with precision and flair. Whether you're a fellow coder navigating through the nebula of data, or a curious mind attracted to the glow of efficient algorithms, this project is your spaceship.

## Features 🌟

- **Warp Speed Efficiency**: Engineered with cutting-edge algorithms that promise not just speed, but also efficiency. It's like the warp drive of sorting!
- **Interstellar Usability**: Simple, intuitive, and ready for lift-off. We've made sure that you spend less time figuring things out and more time soaring through your tasks.
- **Open Source Spacecraft**: Built by a crew of passionate developers, for developers. Join our mission; contributions are welcome!

## How to Board the Ship 🚀

Ready to launch? Setting up **Light Speed Sort** is as easy as initiating a warp drive. Here's how to get started:

1. **Clone this repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Magalvo/light_speed_sort.git`
2. **Navigate to your project directory**: `cd light_speed_sort`
3. **Compile the engine**: Follow the specific instructions based on your environment to compile the project.
4. **Run the command**: `./push_swap [your data here]` and watch as it sorts at light speed!

## Contributing to the Mission 🌠

Your insights and contributions can help make **Light Speed Sort** even faster. Whether you're fixing bugs, proposing new features, or improving the documentation, your help is what propels us forward. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Under the Hood: The Algorithmic Constellation 🛠️✨

At the heart of **Light Speed Sort**, lies a powerful core engineered through the fusion of several universe-class sorting algorithms: **Turk**, **Best Friends**, and **Fast Sort**. This unique combination allows our spaceship to navigate through the most complex data galaxies with unparalleled speed and accuracy.

- **Turk Algorithm**: Inspired by the legendary prowess of the Mechanical Turk, this algorithm cleverly anticipates data patterns, making swift decisions that reduce sorting time dramatically.
- **Best Friends Sorting**: In the vast universe of data, some elements are just meant to be together. Best Friends sorting algorithm identifies and groups these elements early on, optimizing the sorting process through understanding and efficiency.
- **Fast Sort**: The backbone of our operation, Fast Sort, lives up to its name, employing a rapid sorting mechanism that ensures your data is organized at light speed, without sacrificing precision.

Together, these algorithms form the **Algorithmic Constellation**, a proprietary blend of sorting technology that sets **Light Speed Sort** apart from any other sorting tool in the cosmos. By leveraging the strengths of each algorithm, we offer a sorting solution that's not just fast, but also smart and adaptable to various data landscapes.
